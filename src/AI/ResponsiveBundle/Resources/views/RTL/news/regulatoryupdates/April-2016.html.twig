<strong>US State California, OEHHA Proposes Amendment on California Code of Regulation Concerning BPA in Canned and Bottled Foods and Beverages</strong>
<p>On April 1, 2016, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) issued a notice, <a href="http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/040116BPAEmergencyAction.html" target="_blank">Notice of Emergency Action To Amend Section 25603.3 Title 27, California Code of Regulations Warnings for Exposures to Bisphenol A from Canned or Bottled Foods and Beverages</a>, to propose temporary use of a standard point-of-sale warning message for Bisphenol A (BPA) for canned and bottled foods and beverages. The proposed warning message aims to prevent inconsistent warning messages, reduce the chance of confusion among consumers and protect consumers from BPA's reproductive toxicity.</p>
<a href="javascript://" class="learnmore">Read More</a><br />
<div class="moretext">
    <p>BPA was added to the Proposition 65 List May 11, 2015 and its warning requirement begins 1 year thereafter (<a href="http://www.ansecogroup.com/regrecap/5871/" target="_blank">See Regulatory Recap: Issue 2, May 2015</a>). Meanwhile, in a separate rulemaking process, OEHHA is proposing a BPA Maximum Allowable Dose Level (MADL) for dermal exposure but not for oral exposure to BPA from food and beverages. Therefore, the MADL does not cover the epoxy resin lining used in metal-based food and beverage cans. Products with epoxy resin linings can cause exposure to BPA and may require a warning. </p>
    <p>Once the warning label requirement goes into effect, retailers may put warnings on all food and beverage products that may contain BPA, while others may warn selectively and inconsistently. This is due to the fact that canned and bottled foods generally have shelf lives up to 3 years and the current Proposition 65 warning regulation applies to products produces post-May 2015. With a 1 year of transition period, there is still significant volume of stock products were manufactured or produced before May 2015 remaining on shelves without warnings. </p>
    <p>Currently, there is no regulatory requirement for the Proposition 65 warning to name the chemical or its associated health effect. Some businesses may choose to name BPA in their warning message and provide supplementary information about BPA, while others may just simply say that "the food or beverage product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm". Such general messages may cause confusion among consumers and do not serve the public's interest. </p>
    <p>In light of these concerns, the temporary use of a standard and uniform point-of-sale warning message for BPA would address the problems and avoid public confusion resulting from inconsistent warning messages.</p>

<strong>EC Approves PPE Regulation</strong>
<p>On March 9, 2016, European Commission (EC) approved the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0425&from=EN" target="_blank">Regulation (EU) 2016/425 Personal Protective Equipment</a>. This new regulation will repeal the Council Directive 89/686/EEC on April 21, 2018 and enter into force on the same date. The regulation adopts and simplifies certain essential safety requirements from Directive 89/686/EEC and lays down requirements for the design and manufacture of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Manufacturers, distributors and importers of PPE are impacted by this new regulation.</p>
<a href="javascript://" class="learnmore">Read More</a><br />
<div class="moretext">
    <p>Some PPE products that are excluded from the previous Directive are now incorporated into the new PPE Regulation in order to ensure a high level of protection to the user. The newly added products are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">PPE that is designed for private use against heat, such as gloves</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">PPE for self-defense in sport activities</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The new regulation divides PPE's into 3 risk categories and it is the responsibility of manufacturer to carry out a risk assessment in order to identify the risks for the PPE:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
            Category I: Minimal risks, such as
            <ul>

                <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Contact with cleaning materials of weak action or prolonged contact with water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Category II: Risks other than those listed in Categories I and III</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
            Category III: Risks that cause very serious consequences, such as

<strong>EU Proposes More Stringent BPA Requirements for Food Contact Materials and Articles</strong>
<p>On March 14, 2016, the European Union (EU) published a <a href="https://members.wto.org/crnattachments/2016/SPS/EEC/16_1018_00_e.pdf" target="_blank">draft directive regarding the use of bisphenol A (BPA) in varnishes and coatings intended to come into contact with food</a>. The scope of the BPA prohibition in food contact materials or articles is proposed to expand by establishing a migration limit regarding varnish or coating materials that come into contact with food. The Specific Migration Limit (SML) of BPA is proposed to be lowered in Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 on Plastic Materials and Articles intended to Come into Contact with Food.</p>
<a href="javascript://" class="learnmore">Read More</a><br />
<div class="moretext">
    <p>BPA has widely been used in epoxy resins for varnishes and coatings on food cans. Food is possibly exposed to BPA and therefore EU proposes to establish a SML for BPA in varnishes and coatings to ensure a high level of protection to humans. In light of this, a SML of 0.05mg/kg has been proposed. Also, business operators shall ensure that a written declaration of compliance is available for the varnished or coated materials and articles.</p>
    <p>While the SML of BPA under Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 is proposed to be revised from 0.6 mg/kg to 0.05 mg/kg. The BPA requirement for polycarbonate infant feeding bottles will remain unchanged. </p>
