<h2>USA STATE NEWS</h2>
<strong>Additional Chemicals Require CA Prop 65 Warning Labels<em>
</em></strong>Warning labels are now required for substances that were added to the California Proposition 65 list a year ago. These substances are trichloroethylene (required as of January 31, 2015) and DINP (required as of December 20, 2014). There have been twenty seven 60-day notices filed since December 21, 2014 for products found to contain DINP that did not include the warning label.

In addition, dibenzanthracenes and N-nitosomethyl-n-alkylamines have been added to the Proposition 65 list and will require a warning label as of December 26, 2015.

The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has proposed to adopt a No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) of 146 micrograms per day for diisononyl phthalate (DINP). If adopted, a warning label would not be required if it can be demonstrated that exposure is no greater than 146 ug/day. The public comment period is open until March 11, 2015.

<strong>
OEHHA Releases Formal Proposal to Rewrite CA Prop 65 Warning Regulations</strong>
On January 11, California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) updated the pre-regulatory version of the CA Prop 65 warning regulations in Article 6 based on information from the April 2014 workshop and the comments received. A summary of the updated proposed warning regulations and the proposed creation of an informational consumer website are presented below.   OEHHA will hold hearings on both topics on March 25, 2015. Comments for both proposals are due by April 8, 2015.

Summary of the proposed warning regulations:
<ol>
	<li>Clarifies the responsible party to provide warning information:Primary responsibility is assigned to the manufacturer, producer, packager, importer, or distributor of the product. The retailer may have primary responsibility under certain circumstances and has the responsibility to place and maintain any warning materials received from the parties above and ensure the materials are visible to the consumer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>Twelve chemicals will need to be specifically addressed in the warnings: If any of the 12 chemicals are in the product, the warning must specifically call out the chemical to qualify for Safe Harbor. The twelve chemicals are: Acrylamide, Arsenic, Benzene, Cadmium, Carbon Monoxide, Chlorinated Tris, Formaldehyde, Hexavalent Chromium, Lead, Mercury, Methylene Chloride, and Phthalates.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>Will require the use of the hazard symbol: <img class="  alignnone wp-image-5690" src="http://www.ansecogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hazard-symbol-150x150.jpg" alt="hazard symbol" width="37" height="37" /></li>
	<li>Specifies methods of transmission and display requirements for exposure warnings</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li>Changes the required warning language: All warnings will now be required to state that the product “Can expose a person” instead of the current language that states the product “contains a chemical”.</li>
	<li>Specific warnings and content required in certain situations: Furniture products, enclosed parking facilities and amusement parks to name a few now require specific warnings and content.</li>
</ol>
Under the proposed regulation, OEHHA can require a manufacturer, producer, distributor or importer of a product to provide information on the location of the chemical in the product, anticipated routes of exposure, the level of exposure, and any other information that OEHHA deems necessary.   There is also a provision in the regulations that allows the business to claim that the information is a protected trade secret.
<strong>
</strong>If enacted, a new website would provide supplemental information on the following:
<ul>
	<li>How persons are exposed to chemicals and the exposure pathways</li>
	<li>Strategies for reducing exposure to listed chemicals</li>
	<li>Links to government entities who provide information on chemical exposure</li>
</ul>

<strong>Connecticut</strong><strong> – Cadmium in Children’s Jewelry</strong>

Public Act 10-113 restricts cadmium in children's jewelry to 75 ppm and was to take effect July 1, 2014. <a href="http://search.cga.state.ct.us/2014/ACT/PA/2014PA-00140-R00HB-05305-PA.htm">Public Act 14-140</a> moved the date to July 1, 2016. The task force that was created to study the threshold at which cadmium would be considered safe in children’s jewelry made its recommendations in raised bills <a href="http://cga.ct.gov/2015/TOB/H/2015HB-06741-R00-HB.htm">6741</a> and <a href="http://cga.ct.gov/2015/TOB/H/2015HB-06743-R00-HB.htm">6743</a>. The limit for Cadmium in surface coatings would remain at 75 ppm however, other components would be 100ppm by weight or 300 ppm by weight respectively, depending upon which bill is adopted. Either of the raised bills would take effect October 1, 2015 however, this date would need to be reconciled with the July 1, 2016 date.

<strong>New York State Chemicals of High Concern </strong>

New York State has proposed Bill S2408-2015 that would regulate toxic chemicals in children's products.

The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is to publish a Chemicals of High Concern (CHC) list 180 days after enactment. The DEC then is to publish a Priority Chemicals list from the CHC list based on certain criteria such as being found in children's products. The initial Priority Chemicals list has already been established and includes TCEP, benzene, lead, mercury, molybdenum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt. Beginning January 1, 2020, children's products containing a priority chemical cannot be sold one year after the chemical initially appeared on the list. “Children's product” does not include, among other items, batteries and consumer electronic products. If adopted, the law would apply only to new products introduced into the market.

US FDA Issues Guidance for Toy Laser Products
</strong>On December 19, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a guidance entitled “Minimizing Risk for Children’s Toy Laser Products” to provide specific safety recommendations for the manufacturing and labeling of children’s toy laser products.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) recommends that manufacturers keep children’s toy laser products within the FDA Class I or IEC Class 1 emission limits in order to minimize the risk they pose to users and/or others in range of the laser beam, including the vulnerable population for whom they are intended.

Any toy that constitutes, incorporates or is intended to incorporate a laser or laser system is a laser product. See 21 CFR 1040.10(b)(21). As stated above, laser products are subject to the Federal Performance Standards for Laser Products contained in 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11. For purposes of this guidance, “children’s toy laser product” means a product primarily used as a toy that is manufactured, designed, intended or promoted for novelty or visual entertainment use by children under 14 years of age.

This definition is intended to exclude laser products that are used in professional or academic settings that may be used by children (for example, laser printers, CD players, educational and science kits).

The following are examples of children’s toy laser products:
<ul>
	<li>Lasers mounted on toy guns that can be used for “aiming”;</li>
	<li>Spinning tops that project laser beams while they spin;</li>
	<li>Hand-held lasers used during play as “light sabers”;</li>
	<li>Dancing laser beams projected from a stationary column with bright colors or pictures on the box that might appeal to children; and</li>
	<li>Lasers intended for entertainment that create optical effects in an open room with bright colors or pictures on the box that might appeal to children.</li>

<strong>
Updated Standard ASTM F2613-14 “Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Children’s Chairs and Stools is Released</strong>

The Standard ASTM F2613-14 “Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Children’s Chairs and Stools” has been updated to clarify that this standard does not cover  non rigid frames, such as bean bag chairs or foam chairs. This standard also does not apply to seats with restraint systems.

It also updates the definition of “chair” and added a definition for “Rigid Frame”.  Many places within the document where it stated “Chair” or “Folding Chair” it is now replaced by “Product.”

No changes have been made to the testing requirements. ANSECO Group’s Hong Kong lab implemented the 2014 version on December 1, 2014.

Revised  Scope:

1.1 This consumer safety specification establishes testing requirements for structural integrity and performance requirements for children’s chairs and stools. It also provides requirements for labeling. The standard does not apply to products used in a commercial setting or to products that do not have a rigid frame such as bean bag chairs or foam chairs. This standard does not apply to seats with restraint systems. The term unit or product will refer to a child’s chair or stool.

1.2 This specification covers a chair or stool intended to be used by a single child who can get in and get out of the product unassisted and with a seat height 15 in. or less, with or without a rocking base.

3.1.1 children’s chair, n—seating furniture with a rigid frame that is intended to be used as a support for the body, limbs, or feet of a child when sitting or resting in an upright or reclining position.

3.1.9 rigid frame, n—constructed with a frame of rigid materials such as wood, plastic, or metal products
