<h2>USA FEDERAL NEWS</h2>
<strong>CPSC Withdraws Heavy Metals Testing Exemption For Unfinished and Untreated Trunk Wood</strong>

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) had published a Direct Final Rule determining that unfinished and untreated trunk wood does not contain heavy elements that would exceed the limits specified in the toy safety standard ASTM F963-11.  This final rule, which was anticipated to become effective September 15, 2015, would exempt unfinished and untreated trunk wood from the required third party testing for the heavy elements listed in ASTM F963-11. However, the CPSC received significant adverse comments causing them to withdraw the Final Rule on September 10, 2015 without instituting a second comment period on the action.

The CPSC will address the adverse comments they received in a separate Federal Register Notice yet to be published.

<strong>CPSC Solicits Comments on Petition to Declare Organohalogen Flame Retardants "Banned Hazardous Substances"</strong>

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a Notice of Petition for Rulemaking on August 19, 2015 to solicit comments regarding a petition to declare several categories of products containing additive organohalogen flame retardants to be “banned hazardous substances” under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA). The petition, filed by Earthjustice and the Consumer Federation of America jointly with other organizations, claims that these flame retardants are used extensively in certain consumer product categories and will migrate out of the products to the indoor environment.   They further assert that due to their inherent toxicity, exposure to the chemicals will result in adverse human health impacts such as reproductive, neurologic, endocrine, and immunologic disorders as well as cancer.

The petition requests a ban on using organohalogen flame retardants in upholstered furniture, children’s products, childcare articles and toys, mattresses and electronic devices with added organohalogen flame retardants in their plastic casing.  Comments on the Petition for Rulemaking will be accepted by the Commission through October 19, 2015. See the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/a/2015-20454" target="_blank">Federal Register Notice</a> for further information. 

<strong>CPSC and CBP Announce Voluntary Testing of "Single Window" Electronic Filing of Trade Data</strong>

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to conduct a test to assess the electronic filing of certain trade data for regulated finished consumer products under CPSC jurisdiction.  The CPSC is requesting participants to test this “single window” designed to facilitate electronic collection, processing, sharing, and reviewing of trade data and documents required by federal agencies during the cargo import and export processes. The initial intent of this pilot was to require electronic filing of Certificates of Compliance for all regulated imported products.  However, after consultation with stakeholders, the Commission has, for the time being, limited the test to collection of certain minimal targeting/enforcement data, hoping to facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and to enhance targeting of noncompliant products.
Interested parties may file for voluntary participation by October 5, 2015.  To read more, <a href="https://federalregister.gov/a/2015-20707" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<strong>ASTM Publishes Updates to Consumer Trampoline Standard</strong>

ASTM has published ASTM F381-15 Standard Safety Specification for Components, Assembly, Use, and Labeling of Consumer Trampolines.  This updated specification is intended:
<ol>
	<li>To reduce the demonstrated hazards associated with the use of trampolines by consumers;</li>
	<li>To address trampolines used in a home environment by a single user; and </li>
	<li>To not apply to institutional trampolines or trampolines intended for use on water.</li>
</ol>
Trampolines that adhere to this specification are not recommended for use by children under six years of age.

<strong>Updates to <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/38/title38ch16-Dsec0.html" target="_blank">Maine's Toxic Chemicals in Children's Products Law</a></strong>

Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has published its triennial update to its Chemicals of High Concern (CHC) list on July 21, 2015, removing those chemicals that were elevated to Priority Chemicals and those not meeting criteria for a CHC.  There are currently 36 <a href="http://www.maine.gov/dep/safechem/highconcern/index.html" target="_blank">chemicals on the list</a>.

Additionally, Maine’s DEP has designated Formaldehyde as a Priority Chemical requiring reporting in certain children’s products.  This rule became effective July 26, 2015 with reporting required 180 days after this day.  <a href="http://www.ansecogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/096c885-1.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>

<strong>California Proposition 65: Recent Settlements and 60-Day Notices</strong>

In 1986, California voters approved an initiative, California Proposition 65, to address their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. Since its origin, there have been many lawsuits which have resulted in reformulations of consumer products containing carcinogenic and reproductively harmful chemicals on the CA Prop 65 list.

Recent settlements from Q3 of 2015 include the following:

<h2>INTERNATIONAL NEWS – NORTH AMERICA</h2>

<strong>Mexico Standards for Labelling of Textile Products Now In Force</strong>

On November 6, 2014, Mexico’s Ministry of Economy published two New Mexican standards for Labelling of Textile Products in the Official Gazette: (1) NMX-A-2076-INNTEX-2013 and (2) NMX-A-6938-INNTEX-2013. These standards have been adopted as part of the Official Mexican Standard NOM-004-SCFI-2006 for mandatory labelling requirements and come into force on September 9, 2015.

In order to allow manufacturers, importers and marketers time to adjust their production processes to comply with the new requirements specific to NOM-004-SCFI-2006, authorities will accept products that are legally in the country before the effective date.

<u>NMX-A-2076-INNTEX-2013 "Textiles - Chemical fibers – Generic names"</u>
This standard lists the generic names used to designate the different types of chemical fibers currently manufactured on an industrial scale for textile use and other, as well as the distinctive, attributes that characterize them. The term "chemical fibers", sometimes also called fibers manufactured or man-made, has been adopted for those fibers obtained by a process of manufacturing, as distinction of materials which occur naturally in fibrous form. This standard is fully consistent with the International Standard ISO 2076: 2013 Textiles - Man-made fibers -Generic names. 

This standard will supersede NMX-A-099-INNTEX-2007.

<u>NMX-A-6938-INNTEX-2013 "Textiles – Natural fibers – Generic names and Definitions"</u>
This standard provides generic names and definitions of the most common natural fibers in accordance with their constitution or specific origin. It also provides a list in alphabetical order of the names in common use, along with the name’s corresponding standard. This standard is fully consistent with the International Standard ISO 6938: 2012 Textiles - Natural fibers – Generic names and definitions. With this new standard, the words “lana” (wool) and “pelo” (hair) can now be added before the generic name of some animal fibers.

This standard will supersede NMX-A-099- INNTEX-2007.

<strong>New Labelling Regulation for Textiles and Textile Products</strong>

The Central American Technical Regulation RTCA 59.01.08:12 has been approved by the Council of Ministers of Economy and Trade of Central America (COMIECO) as the labelling standard for textile products. This mandatory standard became effective on July 23, 2015 in the member countries including Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. 

This regulation is an adaptation of the Official Mexican Standard NOM-004 SCFI-1994 COMMERCIAL-LABELLING PRODUCT INFORMATION TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES.

NOM-004 SCFI-1994 COMMERCIAL-LABELLING PRODUCT INFORMATION TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES

Scope of the standard:
<ul>
	<li>Garments: shirts, pants, sports uniforms, pantyhose and socks</li>
	<li>Accessories: handkerchiefs, scarves and ties</li>
	<li>Household linens: sheets, blankets, bedspreads, tablecloths, mats napkins, protectors, rugs, curtains, towels, household appliances, ironing board covers, furniture covers and cushions</li>
	<li>Textiles: Court fabrics, rolls, yarns and threads</li>
</ul>

Highlights of the requirement:
<ul>
	<li>The labelling of textiles shall not be misleading or deceptive.</li>
	<li>If the language on the original label is written in a language other than Spanish, a supplementary label written in Spanish must be affixed to the product.</li>
	<li>Textile products sold in pairs made of the same material can be labelled on one of the parts (e.g. stockings and gloves)</li>
	<li>For textile products sold in packages of several units made of different materials, each must be labelled individually to meet the requirements.</li>
	<li>If the product is sold in closed packaging that does not allow the consumer to see the label, the mandatory information must be applied on such packaging.</li>
	<li>If fixing a label directly on the product of certain size and shape can damage the item, then the labelling containing the information required under this regulation can be applied on the packaging, tag or wrapping (e.g. pantyhose, tights, socks, ties, handkerchiefs, scarves, yarn and thread, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<strong>EN 62115:2005/A12:2015 is harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC</strong>

On June 12, 2015, EN 62115:2005/A12:2015 Standard of Electric toys – Safety was harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC and published in the Official Journal of the European Union. There is a transition period through 3 June 2017 during which time conformance with the superseded standard EN62115:2005/A11:2012/AC:2013 shows presumption of conformity to the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC.  

Major revisions under EN 62115:2005/A12:2015:

<ul>
	<li>Heating and abnormal operation: Each low-power circuit is short-circuited by connecting the low-power point to the pole of the power supply from which the measurements are made. If this short circuit results in a hazardous condition, the short circuit is removed and the tests of 9.8.2 a) to f) are applied to the relevant low-power circuits.</li>

	<li>Toys with an integrated field source: Toys with an integrated field source generating EMF shall comply with EN62233:2008 with the following modifications: Toys without a motor, inductor or only include passive electronic components, are considered to comply with this requirement. No measurement is required. Parts of toys consuming a current of 3 A or less are also not applicable.

<strong>New European Standard for Nickel Release</strong>

In July 2015, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) approved Amendment 1 to the standard for nickel release, which is now to become EN 1811:2011+A1:2015 "Reference test method for release of nickel from all post assemblies which are inserted into pierced parts of the human body and articles intended to come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin".

This new standard simplifies the requirement for compliance by removing the “inconclusive” test result range.  Under the new standard, results that fall within that range are now considered “compliant”.  Additionally, due to the 46% measurement uncertainty of the method, the test articles are defined as non-compliant only when the quantified result is greater than or equal to 0.88 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>/week for non-body piercing articles and to 0.35 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>/week for body piercing articles. According to the European Standard EN 1811:2011+A1:2015, conflicting standards shall be withdrawn by January 2016 at the latest.

<strong>Updated European Standard for Bunk Beds and High Beds - EN 747</strong>

In June, 2015, EN 747-1:2012 + A1: 2015 Bunk Beds and High Beds – Safety, Strength and Durability Requirements was published and will supersede the existing European standards by November 2015.

The major revisions in EN 747-1:2012+A1:2015 are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The scope of the standard now applies to bunk beds with an upper surface of the top bed base of 600 mm or more and to high beds with a height to the upper surface of the bed base of 600 mm.</li>
	<li>A safety requirement for head entrapment has been added which applies only to openings where the lowest part is ≥ 600 mm from the floor.</li>
	<li>A requirement for the ventilation of the bed base has been defined as a minimum ventilation area of 35 cm² which can be fulfilled, for example, by 8 holes with a diameter of 24 mm each.</li>
	<li>Instructions for use, warnings and markings have been amended, with some new warnings and labelling in the form of text or pictogram now required.</li>
</ul>

<strong>New Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU</strong>

The New Legislative Framework (NLF), published in the Official Journal of the European Union in August 2008, is designed to help the internal market for goods perform better and to strengthen and modernise the conditions for placing a wide range of industrial products in the EU market. The Low Voltage Directive, one of the eight directives harmonised with NLF as a part of a so-called  ’Alignment Package’, will come into force on April 20, 2016.

The highlights of the New Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The manufacturers, the authorised representative, the importer and the distributor (i.e. economic operators) have the responsibility that products must be compliant with this Directive throughout the whole supply chain until the product gets to the end user.</li>
	<li>The traceability of economic operators throughout the whole supply chain must be unambiguous. The electrical equipment should indicate his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted.</li>
	<li>The manufacturer has to compile the technical documentation, which must make it possible to assess the electrical equipment’s conformity to the relevant requirements. It must also include an adequate analysis and assessment of the risk. The manufacturer is responsible for the risk assessment and the implementation of the necessary measures.</li>
	<li>The Declaration of Conformity template, found in Annex IV, must contain the elements in Module A in Annex III, be continuously updated and be translated into the language or languages required by the Member State in which it is placed on the market.  The Declaration of Conformity must be completed by the economic operator and made available upon the request of the authorities.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Notification of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH Regulation)</strong>

On September 10, 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued Notification of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH Regulation) — Articles 7(2) and 33 — Substances of very high concern present in articles — Duties to notify and provide information — Calculation of threshold of 0.1% weight by weight. 

Based on the provided information, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:

<ol>
	<li>Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 366/2011 of 14 April 2011, must be interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of application of that provision, it is for the producer to determine whether a substance of very high concern identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of that regulation, as amended, is present in a concentration above 0.1% weight by weight of any article it produces and, for the importer of a product made up of more than one article, to determine for each article whether such a substance is present in a concentration above 0.1% weight by weight of that article.</li>
	<li>Article 33 of Regulation No 1907/2006, as amended, must be interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of application of that provision, it is for the supplier of a product one or more constituent articles of which contain(s) a substance of very high concern identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of that regulation in a concentration above 0.1% weight by weight of that article, to inform the recipient and, on request, the consumer, of the presence of that substance by providing them, as a minimum, with the name of the substance in question.</li>
</ol>

This implies that manufacturers must notify the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) when any component of a complex product contains Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) exceeding the 0.1% threshold established by REACH instead of declaring the presence of substances above 0.1% in the entire article.

<strong>Turkey – New Regulations for Labelling and Marking on Fibre Composition in Textile Products</strong>

On April 25, 2015, Turkey’s Ministry of Customs and Trade published Regulation No. 29337 on <b><u>Textile fibre names and the labelling of the fibre composition of textile products and marking</u></b>. The regulation came in force on April 25, 2015, except for Article 13 "textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin", which will become effective on January 1, 2016. This regulation is in compliance with the European Union Legislation 1007/2011.  

The following products are considered textile products to fall within the scope in the Regulation:
<ul>
	<li>Products containing at least 80% by weight of textile fibres;</li>
	<li>Furniture that consists of at least 80% by weight of textile components, umbrellas and awnings;</li>
	<li>The textile components of the following products (provided that they consist of at least 80% by weight of textile components):
<ol>
	<li>The upper layer of multi-layer floor coverings</li>
	<li>Bed covers</li>
	<li>Covers for camping products</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
Composition shall be specified if textiles are combined with other products or form part of a combination.

Labelling or marking should be done in Turkish with required information in accordance with the Regulations by means of a label attached to the product in form of sewing, embroidery or any other means of technology to specify the required information directly on the textile products.
