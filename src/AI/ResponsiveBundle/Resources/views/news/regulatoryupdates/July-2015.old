<strong>CPSC Exempts Untreated Trunk Wood From Third-Party Heavy Metals Testing  </strong>

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has published a direct final rule determining that unfinished and untreated trunk wood does not contain heavy elements that would exceed the limits specified in the toy safety standard ASTM F963-11.   Therefore, unfinished and untreated wood in toys will not require third party testing for the heavy elements listed in ASTM F963-11.   The new rule at 16 CFR Part 1251 is not applicable to pressed wood, plywood, particle board nor wood that has been treated or finished as defined in the rule.

The rule is anticipated to become effective September 15, 2015 unless adverse comments are received by August 17, 2015.

<strong>Various States and Counties Take Action Against Toxic Toys and Children’s Products</strong>

Concerns over toxic chemicals, particularly in children’s products, continue to be addressed at the state level as the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) modernization moves to the U.S. Senate. In addition to state level legislation, several counties in New York State have passed laws banning or restricting chemicals in products intended for children.   Those listed below are in addition to Albany County’s Toxic Free Toys Act, which is supposed to go into effect early 2016 but is currently paused until concerns raised by an industry coalition lawsuit are addressed.  See table below for further information.

<strong>Canadian Government Celebrates Product Safety Achievements</strong>

On June 19, 2015, members of the Canadian Government celebrated the fourth anniversary of the coming into force of the <em>Canada Consumer Product Safety Act </em>(CCPSA) by highlighting some of the its achievements in protecting Canadians from consumer products that pose a danger to human health or safety.

Over the past four years, since the coming into force of the CCPSA, the Government has:
<ul>

These sets, marketed to adults, contain small, powerful magnets that can be easily swallowed or inhaled by children. This led to the <a href="http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2013/34263r-eng.php">first-ever mandatory recall</a> of a consumer product: NeoMagnetic Gadgets Inc. was ordered to issue a recall and stop sale after the company failed to take voluntary action to remove their novelty magnet sets from the marketplace.</li>
	<li>Finalized the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2013-101/"><em>Administrative Monetary Penalties (Consumer Products) Regulations</em></a>, which include fines of up to $25,000 per day for companies who violate orders under the CCPSA.</li>
	<li>Finalized the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2015-97/page-1.html"><em>Exemptions Regulations</em></a>, published April 2015, to ensure that charitable organizations and retailers that sell second-hand consumer products obtained by donation are exempt from certain CCPSA record keeping requirements, except when the donation is from a business.</li>
	<li>Cooperated internationally to issue the first tri-national joint product recall with the United States and Mexico of <a href="http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2014/42149r-eng.php">eight Graco stroller models</a>.</li>
	<li>Improved its ability to <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pubs/indust/incident-quarterly-trimestrialle-dec2104-eng.php">track product safety issues and trends</a> and to communicate important safety information to Canadians.</li>

<strong>Canada: Consumer Product Enforcement Summary, March 2015    </strong>

In March, 2015, Health Canada’s Consumer Product Safety Program (CPSP) provided a summary report to industry and consumers on products that were reviewed by Health Canada.  The report indicates which products meet or do not meet safety standards and includes:
<ul>
	<li>a description of the scope of the enforcement project,</li>
	<li>compliance with regulations,</li>
	<li>testing results, and</li>
	<li>corrective actions.</li>
</ul>
Consumer Product Enforcement Summary Reports are produced by Health Canada at the end of each planned enforcement project.  To read more, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pubs/indust/cpesr-rsarpc-eng.php#a1">click here</a>.

<strong>Mexico Launches Updated Standard for Electrical Products </strong>

On May 28, 2015, the Mexican government launched the updated standard “NOM-003-SCFI-2014E – Electrical Products Safety Specification”. The new requirements will come into force on May 27, 2016, with the exception of the conformity assessment requirements for electrical tools and seasonal decorative products. Electrical tools are subject to Mexican norms NMX-J-038/1-ANCE-2005 and NMX-J524/2-6-ANCE-2013 and the conformity assessment requirements for seasonal decorative products are subject to NMX-J-588-ANCE-2012, which will become effective on May 27, 2017.

Additionally, NOM-003-SCFI-2014 requires electrical products to be designed and constructed to protect the consumer according to various electrical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal hazards.

<strong>China Introduces Mandatory Standard for Children’s Textile Products</strong>

In June 2015, GB 31701-2015 “Safety Technical Code for Infants and Children Textile Products” became a mandatory national standard in China and will come into effect on June 1, 2016 with a 2-year transition period (June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2018). During the transition period, products that are manufactured before June 1, 2016 and fulfill certain standards are still permitted for sale in the market. Starting from June 1, 2018, all products released into the market must comply with this standard.

Categorization according to age:
<ul>
	<li>Textile products for infant: age 36 months or below</li>
	<li>Textile products for child: between ages 3 years old and 14 years old</li>
</ul>
Classification of safety categories:
<ul>
	<li>Safety categories are divided into Class A, B and C according to different requirements. Class A is the highest requirement, followed by Class B and Class C, which is the basic requirement.</li>
	<li>Textile products for infants should meet Class A requirements; Textile products for children with direct skin contact should comply with Class B requirements; Textile products for children with non-direct skin contact should meet Class C requirements, at a minimum.</li>
	<li>Safety categories should be indicated in the instructions on children's wear. Textile products for infants should be marked as "infant product" as well.</li>
	<li>Consumers can refer to the safety category marked on the instructions during purchasing.</li>
</ul>
