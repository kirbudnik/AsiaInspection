<h2>USA STATE NEWS</h2>
<strong>California Panel Votes Unanimously to Add BPA to Prop 65 List
</strong>At a public meeting on May 7, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment’s (OEHHA) scientific panel and the Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification Committee (DART-IC) voted unanimously to <a href="http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/list_changes/051115listBPA.html">add BPA to the Proposition 65 list</a>.

Effective May 11, 2015, bisphenol A (BPA), commonly found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, was added to the list of chemicals known to the state of California to cause reproductive toxicity. Proposition 65 warning requirements will become applicable to consumer products containing BPA that are sold in California, or via the Internet to Californians, one year following the effective date of the listing.

The determination has not been without controversy. In fact, the decision is completely contrary to the specific input provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In April, the FDA’s acting chief scientist submitted a letter to DART-IC stating that the results of the FDA’s comprehensive research “do not support BPA as a reproductive toxicant”.

<strong>Proposed California Bill AB 543
</strong>Legislation has been introduced that would define the term “knowing and intentional” as used in California Proposition 65.  The proposed legislation states that a person, in the course of doing business, does not knowingly and intentionally expose an individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, if an exposure assessment meets the following three requirements:
<ol>
	<li>The exposure assessment was performed by a “qualified scientist” as defined in the regulation</li>
	<li>The assessment states that an individual is not exposed at a level that would require a warning</li>
	<li>The exposure assessment was documented, in writing, before a business received a 60-day notice of violation.</li>
</ol>
The bill has been re-referred to the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee.

<strong>Feedback Received on Proposed Changes to California Proposition 65 “Clear and Reasonable” Warnings
</strong>In March of 2014, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessments (OEHHA) issued a pre-regulatory draft that focused on the changes to the current Proposition 65 warning requirements.  After receiving feedback on the draft, OEHHA released a rewrite of the regulations in January 2015 and allowed parties to provide feedback. The feedback points out a number of issues with the proposed changes. The deadline for adoption of the final regulation is January 2016.
<ul>
	<li>Special requirements for twelve Chemicals – The proposed regulation has special requirements for twelve chemicals that if present, must be called out by name in the Proposition 65 warning. The concern with singling out just these twelve chemicals is that it could lead consumers to think that these are the most hazardous and they don’t have to be as concerned with the other chemicals and will ignore them.</li>
	<li>A request to clarify if it is acceptable to use other methods of warning as the proposed regulation states it provides the “minimum elements” of an acceptable warning.</li>
	<li>There are concerns with the proposal to simplify chemical names and list groups of chemicals such as “Phthalates” as it may confuse consumers. It was suggested to use the scientific name of the chemical so consumers can research it.</li>
	<li>The effective date of the proposed regulation would be two years after adoption. Many coating manufacturers have products with a shelf life more than two years.  The American Coatings Association has requested the regulation provide an unlimited sell through period covering any product that was manufactured and labeled prior to the adoption of the regulation.</li>
	<li>There is no guidance in the new regulation on what a “clear and reasonable” warning is. Since there is no guidance, businesses will decide to use the example in the regulation even if it is not relevant to their product instead of risking that their language will pass any litigation.</li>
	<li>The proposed regulation provides a retailer the ability to avoid litigation if they take preventative action within two days of receiving a 60-day notice. The concern is that two days is too short of a period.</li>
</ul>
On May 22, 2015 OEHHA provided <a href="http://www.ansecogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Modified-Proposed-Regulation-Title-27-Section-25205-5-22-15.pdf">notice of additional changes</a> to the proposed regulation to add Section 25205 Lead Agency Website.   Based on previous comments received OEHHA has modified the proposed regulation as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Changes were made to subsection (b) regarding OEHHA’s disclaimer on the website</li>
	<li>Subsection (b)(10) was changed to limit the scope of the information OEHHA may request</li>
	<li>A new subsection (c) was added to state that testing is not required for the sole purpose of providing information to OEHHA in response to a request</li>
	<li>The use of the term “Confidential Business Information” was replaced with “Trade Secret”. The term “Trade Secret” is defined in Civil Code Section 3426.1</li>
	<li>The 15 day notice period required for notification of a business under section (d)was extended to 30 days</li>
</ul>
OEHHA is accepting written comments on the amendments to the proposed regulation until June 6, 2015 at 5 PM.

<strong>Federal Ruling Halts Enforcement of Albany County “Toxic Toys” Law
</strong>A federal judge has granted a motion to stay Albany County's law banning the sale of "toxic toys" and other children's products containing certain chemicals. On May 15, Judge Andrew J. Baxter of the U.S. Northern District court in Albany granted the motion after a coalition of national trade groups, including the Toy Industry Association (TIA), filed a federal lawsuit deeming the chemical ban a violation of the supremacy clause of the constitution.  They argued that, by exceeding federal standards and banning children’s products containing even trace amounts of seven harmful substances, the county set a bar that manufacturers and retailers would be unable to meet. By granting the stay, the suit and enactment of the law, which is supposed to go into effect January 12, 2016, are paused as the county addresses the concerns brought up in the lawsuit and develops the regulations that will define enforcement.

A similar ban in Westchester County was signed into law by County Executive Robert Astorino. The Children’s Product Safety Act will prevent the sale of infant and children’s products that include eight harmful toxic chemicals including arsenic, mercury and cadmium within Westchester County. This law is very similar to the Albany County Law that was stayed.

<strong>Inter American Rapid Alerts System
</strong>The Consumer Safety and Health Network (CSHN) publicly launched the second phase of implementation of the <a href="https://www.sites.oas.org/rcss/EN/Pages/alerts/default.aspx">Inter-American Rapid Alerts System</a> on March 6, 2015, allowing members of The Organization of American States (OAS) to exchange information on consumer safety alerts. The system, known as “SIAR” for its Spanish acronym, was designed to provide a rapid and secure platform for the exchange of consumer product safety information, such as recalls, among member countries including the United States of America, Canada, Mexico and 32 additional independent countries of the Americas.

The system includes both public and restricted access modules designed for the creation, management and rapid exchange of alerts based on agreed upon criteria. Alerts are available for The Americas, and can be sorted by member country. They are also available from other regions’ alert systems, such as Europe’s RAPEX and The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), as an effort to help member countries identify consumer product safety concerns and take measures to prevent product from being sold that does not comply with their country’s requirements.

Announced by the Vice-Chairman of the CSHN Steering Committee, Dr. Herbert Tassano, SIAR was described as “a system that saves lives,” benefiting upwards of 200,000 consumers to date. Available in the four official languages of the OAS (English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish), SIAR includes a feature to review “trends” that have been reported in the portal as well as a feature allowing users to generate customized reports based on areas of interest such as dates, product origin, and type of injury, among others.  The information however, may lag behind the countries’ recall notices.

<strong>EU EXPANDS LEAD RESTRICTION UNDER REACH
</strong>The European Union (EU) has expanded the scope of restriction of lead in articles, or accessible parts of articles for the general public, if such articles or components may be placed in the mouth by children.  The Regulation will apply to all products that are placed on the market after June 1, 2016.

Currently, Entry 63 of Annex XVII of REACH restricts lead and its compounds in Jewelry articles. On April 23, 2015, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.104.01.0002.01.ENG">Regulation (EU) 2015/628[2]</a> was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) expanding the scope of lead restriction to articles or accessible parts of articles for the general public, if it may be placed in the mouth by children during normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. An article or accessible part of an article may be placed in the mouth by children if it is smaller than 5 centimeters in one dimension or has a detachable or protruding part of that size.

Products under the new amendment shall not contain lead content exceeding 0.05% (500 ppm). That limit shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that the rate of lead release from such an article or any such accessible part of an article, whether coated or uncoated, does not exceed 0,05 μg/cm<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span> per hour (equivalent to 0,05 μg/g/h), and, for coated articles, that the coating is sufficient to ensure that this release rate is not exceeded for a period of at least two years of normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use of the article.

<strong> Reminder: REACH Chromium VI Restriction Comes into Effect
</strong>On March 26, 2014, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1430725323452&amp;uri=CELEX:32014R0301">Regulation (EU) 301/2014</a> was published, which added a Chromium VI restriction to Annex XVII of REACH. The regulation stipulates that leather articles coming into contact with skin cannot contain Chromium VI in excess of 3 mg/kg.

The Regulation affects articles that are placed on the market after May 1, 2015.

<strong>EN71 Standards Harmonized under </strong><strong>Toy Safety Directive
</strong>On March 13, 2015 the European Commission published the amended standards EN71 Part 1: 2014 and EN71 Part 3 +A1:2014, as well as the new Trampolines for Domestic Use standard EN71-14:2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) as <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/european-standards/harmonised-standards/toys/index_en.htm">harmonized standards to the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC</a>.  The amended standards will come into force after February 29, 2016.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to EN 71-1:2014 Mechanical and Physical Properties</span>

The EN71-1:2014 revision was needed to align the standard with the new European Committee for Standardization (CEN) rules and contains only one technical change: a 6 mm tolerance was added to the self-retraction cord measurement (clause 5.4.e for any of the testing conditions specified in 8.39, self-retracting cords). The amendments will come into force after February 29, 2016.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to EN 71-3:2013+A1:2014 Migration of Certain Elements</span>

The A1 amendment provides more details on:

• pH control and adjustment
• importance of ensuring test portion is wetted and remains dispersed during agitation
• means of agitation

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New EN 71-14:2014 Safety of Toys – Part 14: Trampolines for Domestic Use</span>

This standard is applicable to trampolines for domestic use, intended to be used indoor or outdoor above ground level by one person. Trampolines for professional, medical or fitness use are excluded. With the new harmonized EN71-14 Trampolines standard, products within the scope will no longer require an EC type examination.

<strong>
Japan New Safety Standard for Cords and Drawstrings on Children’s Clothing
</strong>On June 23, 2014, the Japanese Industrial Standard Committee (JISC) formulated a new standard, the “FDJIS L 4129 Safety of children’s clothing – Cords and drawstrings on children’s clothing”. Specifications and the final Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) will be promulgated in December 2015.

The new FDJIS L 4129 defines the requirements for a cord that is attached to clothing for children. However, the standard does not contain requirements for special needs clothing for those affected children.

<strong>Japan Proposes to Restrict Azo Dyes in Household Products<a href="http://cl.s6.exct.net/?qs=87ca89953fa6c40b4823dd977aebede364d741fa69259e78817811b158591de7">
</a></strong>On December 17, 2014, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan notified the World Trade Organization (WTO) of its intention to designate azo dyes as harmful substances under the Control of Household Products Containing Harmful Substances Act. According to the document released by the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization (WTO), such regulation is scheduled to enter into force on April 1, 2016.

The Act specifies the household products containing azo compounds that are forbidden from being marketed in Japan when containing harmful substances beyond the criteria specified by the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Act. The MHLW designates azo compounds that may cause the presence of any of the specified 24 aromatic amines described as harmful substances in the Act.

The MHLW has also determined the test methods concerning azo compounds. The presence of any of the specified aromatic amines must be less than 30 mg/kg when tested with a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS).

Below is a list of the 24 specified aromatic amines:

<strong>New amendment to the EU Electric Toy Safety Standard
</strong>On January 31, 2015, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) published the new amended Electric Toys Safety Standard EN 62115:2005+A12:2015. This document supersedes EN 62115:2005+ A11:2012 which will be harmonized later this year.

The amendment adds requirements for toys with an integrated field source generating electromagnetic fields (EMF). These toys shall comply with EN 62233:2008 “<em>Measurement methods for electromagnetic fields of household appliances and similar apparatus with regard to human exposure” </em>with the following modifications:
<ol>
	<li>Toys without a motor, inductor or which only include passive electronic components, are considered to comply with this requirement without measurement. The requirements do not apply to parts of toys consuming a current of 3 A or less.</li>
	<li>In EN 62233:2008, A.2.3 “Measuring distances and sensor location”, additional requirement is added.</li>
	<li>When the markings or instructions are on the packaging, it shall also be stated that the packaging must be retained since it contains important information.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Nearly 2500 Dangerous Products Withdrawn from the EU Market in 2014</strong><strong>
</strong>On March 23, 2015, <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4627_en.htm">the European Commission published a report</a> showing that in 2014, nearly 2500 products, ranging from toys to motor vehicles, were either stopped before they entered the EU or removed from markets because they were considered dangerous to EU consumers.

The Rapid Alert System (RAPEX) ensures that information about dangerous non-food products withdrawn from the market and/or recalled anywhere in Europe is quickly circulated between Member States and the European Commission.

In 2014, toys (28%) and clothing, textiles and fashion items (23%) were the two main product categories for which corrective measures had to be taken. Among the most frequently notified risks caused by these products were risk of injury, chemical risks and choking.

The most common chemical risks notified in 2014 were related to products such as shoes and leather articles (e.g. Chromium VI, a skin sensitizing substance), toys and childcare articles (e.g. plastic softener, which can cause fertility problems), and fashion jewellery (e.g. harmful heavy metals).

In 2014, 64% of the total number of notifications on dangerous products came from China, the same as in 2013. The European Commission collaborates closely with China through the "Rapid alert system-CHINA" application to ensure that the Chinese authorities tackle any product safety issues on the ground.

<strong>OECD Invites Comments on a Proposal to Improve Global Tracking of Products
</strong>The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) invites comments on a <a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/consumer/Track%20trace%20project%20for%20early%202015%20public%20comment.pdf">proposal to improve tracking information on consumer products. </a> The ideal tracking/traceability information would be represented as a globally recognized unique product identifier (UPI) mark or code for a specific product.  This UPI mark or code would be supported by a data system with a mechanism to allow:
<ol>
	<li>anyone to look up the mark or code and match it to a product, and</li>
	<li>for regulators to access non-public information about the product, such as the actual manufacturer, manufacturing site identification and supply chain information</li>
</ol>
The mark would contain information similar to the CPSC’s May 2013 proposal for amending 16 CFR Part 1110.

The OECD is asking for comments by May 30, 2015.
