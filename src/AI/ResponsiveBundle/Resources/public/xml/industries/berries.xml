            <p>Even in a well-managed produce supply chain, a product like berries can present a challenge. The firmness and appearance of the berries is crucial to the consumer’s decision to buy, especially since berries are often purchased on impulse, as a snack or as an addition to the shopping list. At the same time, berries are very delicate, highly perishable, and easily damaged, which makes proper quality control paramount at every stage between farm and shelf.</p>
            <p>AI offers product <a href="/pre-shipment-inspection">inspections</a> and <a href="/quality-control-services/laboratory-testing">lab testing</a> for your berry shipments, to help you ensure quality at every step and avoid rejections by retailers. We will monitor the state of your product immediately post-harvest, before shipping, and on arrival, giving you timely and reliable data to make informed decisions.</p>
