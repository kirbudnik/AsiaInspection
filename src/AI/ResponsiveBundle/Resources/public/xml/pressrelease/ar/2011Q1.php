	<h2>Manufacturing Moving to China's Interior</h2>

	AsiaInspection service figures show significant increases in inspections performed in China's rural inland provinces, reflecting a shift of manufacturing operations in China to the west and north.
	From Q3 2010 to Q1 2011, inspections in Anhui Province have increased +175% and +118% in Hebei Province. Many factory workers, originally from inland regions,
	are staying home after Chinese New Year to fill new jobs closer to home, preferring the lower inland province average wages of $114 USD, but with a lower cost-of-living,
	to the higher average coastal city wages of $205 USD, but with rampant inflation.
	</p>
	<p>
	These new jobs are a result of companies moving inland to take advantage of these lower labor costs.
	This fall, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn will complete construction of a new plant in inland Henan province. According to AsiaInspection figures, from June 2010 until January 2011, inspections performed in Henan
	increased +78%. Other Fortune 500 's moving inland include HP to Chongqing and Intel to Chengdu, with more companies expected to follow soon (Financial Times).

	"China's coastal cities have begun to improve themselves in recent years as reliable suppliers that can produce to international quality standards."
	said Sebastien Breteau, CEO of AsiaInspection. "The manufacturing sector of provinces from rural inland China have not yet fully matured,
	nor maintained the same quality levels as developed coastal regions. It's vital that businesses outsourcing manufacturing to those regions ensure every product meets international quality and safety standards."

	<h2>Chinese Exports to Iran Continue to Increase Thanks to U.S. Sanctions</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="para">
	<p>
	Despite continued turmoil in the region, the Middle East was up +40% year-over-year. Within the region, Iran saw the largest increase, up +215%.
	Thanks to increasing trade sanctions against Iran by the U.S. and other Western nations, China-Iran trade has increased over the last decade, from $2.5 billion USD in 2000 to $29 billion in 2010;
	this number is expected to increase to $50 billion by 2015.As U.S. allies continue to pull out of Iran, China is increasing its presence in the country, developing oilfields, importing minerals and exporting $11.1 billion worth of goods,
	including industrial machinery and construction materials.
	</p>
	<p>
	Inspection by category figures for the same period reflect this trend, with Construction and Mechanical Items up +30%, increasing for the first time since 2009, and with Home and Gardenware up +43%.
