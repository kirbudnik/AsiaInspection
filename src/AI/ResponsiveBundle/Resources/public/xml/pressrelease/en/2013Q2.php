<p><b>Shenzhen, China, July 5, 2013</b> - AsiaInspection, a leading provider of quality control services for businesses importing from Asia and Africa, today announces the AsiaInspection 2013 Q2 Barometer, a quarterly synopsis of Asia-based manufacturing and the quality control services industry.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Silver Lining to a Fatal Quarter: Rise in Social Audits</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wake of the tragic fire at the Tarzeen Fashion Factory in late 2012, thousands more factory workers died in preventable accidents across the Asian Continent in Q2 2013. <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> was once again the major focus after a factory collapse in Dhaka on 13 May killed over 1,100 people. During Q2 there were also continuous reports of deaths in factory fires<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup> which kept <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in the limelight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meanwhile, AsiaInspection saw a <b>+56%</b> increase in <a href="/ethical-audit">Social Audit</a> orders including, notably, Fire Safety Audits in Asia in Q2 2013 compared to Q2 2012.  In particular, <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> orders increased <b>+64%</b> with other Asian countries following close behind; China (<b>+41%</b>) and India (<b>+53%</b>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Global brands were singled out as responsible parties<sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup> after it was found that their products were produced in the affected factories, which caused them to initiate <a href="/quality-control-services">Audit programs</a> across their supply chains as a first response. The largest apparel brands later took a clearer stance towards worker safety by signing the Bangladesh Fire and Safety Accord in May<sup style="font-size:10px;">3</sup>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The backlash caused by these disasters resulted in Western buyers understanding the full impact of ethical and social non-compliance in their supply chain. A recent consumer survey<sup style="font-size:10px;">4</sup> showed that 70% of people were willing to pay more for their clothes if they knew that workers were being paid a fair wage in good conditions: the Bangladesh events may have finally changed consumers' attitudes and made a winning case for brands and importers to significantly focus on Social conditions in manufacturing premises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most requested standard by buyers was the Global Standard <a href="/ethical-audit">SA8000</a>, which encourages organizations to develop, maintain and apply socially acceptable practices in the workplace.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Consumers Forcing Brands into Full Supply Chain Monitoring</h2>
<p>Consumer demand for quality goods at competitive prices has traditionally caused importers to focus on <a href="/quality-control-services">Product Inspections</a>, such as <a href="/pre-shipment-inspection">Pre-Shipment Inspections</a> and <a href="/container-loading-check">Container Loading Checks</a> to reduce cost and waste. Whilst inspections are still on the rise (<b>+22%</b> in Q2 2013 compared to Q2 2012), <a href="/">AsiaInspection</a> figures show that besides <a href="/ethical-audit">Social Auditing</a>, there is also additional demand from importers for <a href="/manufacturing-audit">Factory Manufacturing Practices Audits</a> (<b>+38%</b>).</p>
<p>In particular Q2 2013 saw increased interest from buyers around the globe in finding ways to tackle sub-contracting to unlicensed factories. It is often difficult to get full visibility over one's supply chain when relying on 3rd party factories, and <a href="/manufacturing-audit">Factory Audit programs</a> coupled with Inspections at the actual manufacturing location are found to be an efficient monitoring solution.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Manufacturing Competition: China, Vietnam, India & Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Q2 Performed <a href="/">Inspections in China</a> continued to grow in double-digits, at <b>+15%</b> vs. last year. Even if China still dominates global manufacturing (retaining its crown as the world's largest manufacturer and still exporting in value <b>20 times</b> more than <a href="/quality-control-vietnam">Vietnam</a> or <b>70 times</b> more than <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> for instance), AsiaInspection figures showed that Performed Inspection growth was higher in Vietnam (<b>+38%</b>), India (<b>+35%</b>) and Bangladesh (<b>+44%</b>).</p>
<p>Although China is set to remain as the major sourcing region in Asia, as described in <a href="/asia-inspection-news">AI previous barometers</a>, structural changes including an expected <b>+9.2%</b> increase in wages in 2013<sup style="font-size:10px;">6</sup> are starting to make other Asian countries a more attractive option for manufacturing goods which are lower down the value added chain, such as <a href="/testing/garments-apparel">garments and textiles</a>.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Chinese Food Scandals Cause Jump in Food Inspections</h2>
<p>Despite continuous scandals that expose problems in the Chinese food supply (high levels of toxic chemical Cadmium found in rice<sup style="font-size:10px;">7</sup>, rat meat being passed off as lamb<sup style="font-size:10px;">8</sup> and eggs preserved with a toxic additive<sup style="font-size:10px;">9</sup>) China remains a growing source of food for export, with the FDA estimating an annual <b>+9%</b> growth in exports to the US<sup style="font-size:10px;">10</sup>.</p>
<p>This means global importers are incentivised more than ever to check their supply chains and <a href=/"">AsiaInspection</a> figures show an increase for Performed <a href="http://www.asiafoodinspection.com" target="_blank">Food Inspections</a> of <b>+72%</b> in Q2 2013 compared to Q2 2012, with China seeing the biggest growth at <b>+84%</b>. In addition, <a href="/">AsiaInspection</a> figures showed an increase of <b>+27%</b> in <a href="http://www.asiafoodinspection.com" target="_blank">Food Hygiene Audits</a> (GHP) abiding to international requirements, as well as individual HACCP plans.</p>
