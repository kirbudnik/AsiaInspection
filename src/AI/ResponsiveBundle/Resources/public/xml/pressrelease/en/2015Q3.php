<p style="text-align:justify;">While the economy of China may be growing at its slowest pace in six years, global brands are readily expanding their supply chains to other low-cost destinations in Asia. Looking at July 2014 to June 2015 vs. July 2013 to June 2014, AsiaInspection data shows a moderate <b>7%</b> growth of <a href="/quality-control-in-china" style="text-decoration:none;">product inspections performed in China</a> – on par with the country’s GDP growth. That said, growth was staggering in nearly every other Southeast Asian country. Inspections in Cambodia grew at an unprecedented <b>227%</b> year over year; Vietnam, <b>172%</b>; Myanmar, which in recent years has relaxed import restrictions and abolished export taxes, saw <b>133%</b> growth; Indonesia, <b>114%</b>; Thailand, <b>102%</b>; Bangladesh, <b>81%</b>; and even the less known Pakistan showed a <b>47%</b>  increase.</p>
<div class="display500" style="padding:0px 0px 15px 15px;width:270px;float:right;">

	</center>
	<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While most of the Southeast Asia growth seems driven by apparel exports, there are notable exceptions.  The most commonly inspected products by AI were furniture in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; <a href="/testing/footwear">footwear</a> in <a href="/quality-control-vietnam">Vietnam</a>, bags in Thailand, and audio and video equipment in South Korea.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">“The overall trend in Southeast Asia, and the rate of growth outside of China is unprecedented,” said Sebastien Breteau, AI CEO. “While the upward trend has been present there in recent years, AI is seeing demand like never before. Two years ago, China represented 91% of inspections, and today its share is 78%.” While brands may be continuing to work with established partner factories in China, the data suggests new sourcing is taking place elsewhere.</p>


<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Vietnam – Growth Continues, Ethical Compliance Scores Lead Asia</h2>

<p>Vietnam is now the world's 4th largest garment exporter,<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">1</sup></a> and is working to increase its share of exports with major expansion plans for its garment industry and several free trade agreements – some already signed and some in the works (including the ongoing Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations).<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">2,</sup></a> <a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">3</sup></a> Not only have inspections performed increased by <b>172% Y-O-Y</b>, but <a href="/ethical-audit">ethical audit</a> scores were the highest of the big four in Asia according to AI figures.  Over the past 12 months <a href="/quality-control-vietnam">Vietnam</a> had a score of <b>6.7</b> out of 10, ahead of India at <b>6.6</b>, China <b>6.2</b> and <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> <b>6.5</b>.</p>
<p>Some of Vietnam's improvement can be attributed to the recent progress made in the country's labor laws, better worker representation,<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">4</sup></a> and efforts to increase safety awareness.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">5</sup></a> Intel noted the same trend when publishing their <a href="/ethical-audit">ethical audit</a> scores at their <a href="/quality-control-vietnam">Vietnam</a> assembly facility.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">6</sup></a> </p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Relaxed Trade Barriers Fuel Growth in Myanmar</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Myanmar's garment industry continues expanding fast, with the sector's export earnings target set at US$ 2 billion in the fiscal year 2015-2016.  In the last two years alone, 100,000 new workplaces have been created in the garment sector, where foreign investment accounts for 90 percent.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">7</sup></a> Foreign investment increased from US$ 300 million in 2009-10 to US$ 5 billion in 2014-15, an annual growth rate of 75.5%.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">8</sup></a> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Interestingly, product quality in the country well exceeded the Asia average, as measured by the <a href="/aql-acceptable-quality-limit">acceptable quality level</a> results of onsite inspections. Acceptable quality tolerances failed in <b>22%</b> of inspections – better than that of Cambodia at <b>25%</b>, India <b>28%</b>, <a href="/quality-control-in-china" style="text-decoration:none;">China</a> b>32%</b>, and Bangladesh <b>37%</b>. This is likely a reflection of recent investment, and hence new infrastructure, coupled with strict oversight as buyers employ strict controls as they cautiously move into the country.</p>


<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Lack of Food Safety Regulations Kills 2.2 Million People Yearly</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.asiafoodinspection.com/" target="_blank">Food safety</a> is the theme of this year's World Health Day. According to the WHO data, 2.2 million people die every year as a result of food and waterborne diseases. The scale and complexity of food supply chains greatly increase the risk of contamination and spread of disease, with enormous health and economic consequences.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">9</sup></a> The importance of food safety regulations was once again thrown into sharp contrast by the recent food scandal, in which 800 tons of smuggled frozen meat was confiscated in China.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">10</sup></a></p>
<p>China's revised Food Safety Law, to come into effect this October, introduces tighter production, shipping, and storage requirements, as well as increased penalties for violations. </p>
<p>As the focus on safety increases in the food industry, <a href="http://www.asiafoodinspection.com/" target="_blank">AsiaFoodInspection</a> saw a 49% increase in performed services over the past 12 months compared to the 12 months before, making <a href="http://www.asiafoodinspection.com/" target="_blank">food inspections</a> AI's highest growth category. The most recent results of those inspections show a <b>37%</b> failure rate in Q2 – a slight improvement on the Q1 figure (41%). </p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Southeast Asia Tightens Environmental Restrictions</h2>
<p>Environmental concerns are becoming increasing prominent as countries adopt and enforce more stringent environmental regulations. The Indian environmental authorities disrupted supply chains by ordering the closure of nearly 900 textile units for their failure to install effluent treatment facilities,<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">11</sup></a> while Vietnam recently rejected an investment proposal worth US$ 200 million, deeming the proposed textile and dyeing plant “environmentally unsound”.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">12</sup></a> Meanwhile, China released the Action Plan for Water Pollution Prevention and Control, authorities warn of the imminent crackdown on illegal discharges and falsification of monitoring data.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">13,</sup></a> <a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup style="font-size: 10px;">14</sup></a> </p>
