<p style="text-align:justify;">2013 was a challenging year for brands and retailers worldwide in the face of increasing supply chain social issues, most notably the Rana Plaza tragedy in May, where a factory collapse in Bangladesh took the lives of 1,129 people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strikes and riots erupted throughout the year in factories across India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar with workers demanding higher wages.  In Bangladesh the minimum wage is half that of China; Cambodia is currently $80 per month, increasing to $95 in April 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Child labor<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration:none;"><sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup></a> was put back in the spotlight when a report was published by the US Department of Labor in October 2013 which reported 78 million children are engaged in child labor in the Asia and Pacific region.<a href="#footnotes" style="text-decoration:none;"><sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Figures for <a href="/">AsiaInspection</a> reflect brands and retailers are taking action, showing a <b>+61%</b> increase in Audits in Asia for 2013 compared with 2012. While Bangladesh was in the spotlight, buyers took to securing their supply chain in all sourcing regions, with <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">Audits in Bangladesh</a> up <b>+47%</b> year over year, China <b>+58%</b> and India <b>+112%</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of the tragic incidents in Bangladesh and its predominant apparel manufacturing sector, news emerged of buyers starting to look for alternatives in the region.  <a href="/">AsiaInspection</a> ordered inspection figures support this.  While <a href="/quality-control-bangladesh">inspections in Bangladesh</a>, the largest exporter for apparel in volume after China, were up <b>+36%</b> year over year, India exceeded this with <b>+44%</b> inspection growth, Vietnam <b>+71%</b> and Cambodia <b>+114%</b>.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">With Christmas Behind Us, Are Chinese Toys Finally Safe?</h2>
<p>China continues to dominate toy manufacturing with <b>80%+</b> of all toys sold in western countries being made in China.   With another Christmas season behind us, which is when up to <b>70%</b> of all toy sales occur, consumer safety was on the agenda last quarter.</p>
<p>In November, 200,000 dolls made-in-China were seized at US ports for containing high levels of <a href="/phthalate-toys-laboratory-testing">phthalates</a> (a banned chemical used in plastic).  The same happened this December in France with 30,000 non-compliant Chinese toys destroyed by customs. Concurrently, a U.S. Public Interest Research group analyzed 50 toys and found lead 29 times the safety limit, banned phthalates, excessive levels of cadmium and choking risks.</p>
<p>AsiaInspection data on the toys & recreational industry shows a worrying trend with the number of failed toy inspections in Asia rising from <b>27%</b> in 2012 to <b>33%</b> in 2013. While most failed inspections were for minor non-life threatening issues, more than <b>4%</b> of <a href="/testing/toy-safety-and-lab-testing">toy testing</a> by AI did not pass safety standards.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Sourcing Power: China versus the Rest of the World</h2>
<p>Despite fears that China's competitiveness would be eroded by the appreciation of the RMB and wage inflation, China's exports continue to set new highs. November was up <b>12.7%</b> compared with a year earlier, and for the period of January to November, 2013 showed a <b>9.3%</b> increase compared to 2012.  This puts China on track to report the largest annual trade surplus since 2008.</p>
<p><a href="/">AsiaInspection</a> inspection figures mirror this with a <b>+17%</b> increase in ordered <a href="/quality-control-in-china" style="text-decoration:none;">inspections in China</a> in 2013 compared with 2012.  In 2013, China remained by far the largest sourcing region used by AI clients.  To put it in perspective, Bangladesh exports amounted to a mere <b>1%</b> to that of China.</p>
<p>In terms of percentage growth, 2013 confirmed the trend for new sourcing regions with Africa seeing a <b>47%</b> increase in the second half of the year. Vietnam was up by <b>71%</b> and Cambodia doubled despite protests over wage concerns.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">What to Expect in 2014 Global Sourcing</h2>
<p>2013 was the year when supply chain management, or rather the lack thereof, made headlines and became a concern not only for sourcing professionals, but for consumers as well. The Rana Plaza tragedy, the horsemeat scandal in Europe and repeated food safety horror stories in China raised awareness globally on the need for a stricter end-to-end supply chain management.</p>
<p>"The common situation when a Western buying office does not know precisely where the products they purchase are manufactured and what's going on in their outsourced factories is doomed", said Sebastien Breteau, CEO of AsiaInspection.  "Major names like H&M, Apple and HP have published the list for all or part of all their approved suppliers. We will see more of such initiatives with major brands taking back full control and enforcing visibility over their suppliers. Expect 2014 to be the year transparency becomes a reality in global supply chains."</p>
