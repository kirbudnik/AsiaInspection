<p><b>Hong Kong, September 22, 2015</b>- Testing the safety of products is critical for all manufacturers – the health and safety of consumers is paramount and strict standards apply. </p>



<p>Finding a supplier that makes the process as straightforward as possible just got easier with today’s announcement that AsiaInspection, a fast-expanding international testing, inspection and auditing company, has acquired Anseco Group, a US-headquartered laboratory company that specializes in testing toys, children’s products and hardlines.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of these products can now benefit from the integration of Anseco’s expert laboratories with AsiaInspection’s market-leading online booking and reporting capabilities. The web-based platform enables retailers and brands to instantly confirm, cancel or view the results of their product tests in real-time from any device and use the data to instantly analyse which factories consistently support their supply chain the best.</p>

<p>“The ease at which clients can arrange and manage any tests or inspections they require is at the very centre of our business so we are naturally very excited to be bringing the AsiaInspection model to a wider audience” says Sebastien Breteau, CEO of AsiaInspection.</p>

<p>"We share with Anseco the same customer-focused culture. All our clients, both now and in the future, will benefit from the coming together of two innovative, young companies committed to delivering the best.”</p>

<p>The acquisition means that AsiaInspection will now have two additional accredited in-house laboratories under its umbrella, furthering its capabilities to support clients in North America and Asia; the Buffalo, New York lab is an ISO17025 accredited facility and the Hong Kong lab is an HOKLAS accredited facility.</p>
