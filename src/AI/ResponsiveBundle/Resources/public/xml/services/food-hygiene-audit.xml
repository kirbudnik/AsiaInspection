                <title>What is GHP Compliance?</title>
                <pgph>GHP compliance covers the minimum sanitary and hygiene practices for food processors, such as hotels and restaurants, to ensure that food is safe and suitable for human consumption. It is a required foundation to implement other food safety management initiatives, such as GMP, HACCP and ISO 22000.</pgph>
                <pgph>The US FDA and other regulatory bodies worldwide recommend GHP compliance to ensure that a company is committed to reducing food contamination and food-borne diseases by implementing food safety practices.</pgph>
